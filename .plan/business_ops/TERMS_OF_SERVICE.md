# Terms of Service

By commissioning me, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms below.

## 1. General Terms
- **Acceptance**: I reserve the right to decline any commission request without providing a reason.
- **Communication**: All correspondence should be conducted via email or the platform's messaging system. Please allow 24-48 hours for a response.
- **Age Restriction**: You must be legally able to enter into a contract. I strictly do **NOT** accept NSFW commissions.

## 2. Payment & Refunds
- **Currency**: Primary currency is **PHP**. Payments are processed securely via **Xendit** (accepts GCash, Maya, Credit/Debit Cards, and Bank Transfer).
- **Payment Structure**:
  - **Upfront**: 100% payment required for commissions under ₱5,000.
  - **Split Payment**: 50% non-refundable deposit to start, remaining 50% before file delivery for larger projects.
- **Refunds**:
  - **Before Start**: 100% refund if I have not started working on your commission.
  - **After Sketch**: 50% refund if cancelled after the sketch phase.
  - **After Lineart/Coloring**: No refunds once the artwork has passed the sketch approval stage.
- **Chargebacks**: Any unauthorized chargebacks will result in an immediate blacklist. I retain the right to dispute the chargeback with evidence of work documented.
- **Kill Fee**: If a project is cancelled by the client halfway through for reasons unrelated to my performance, the non-refundable deposit serves as the kill fee to cover time lost.

## 3. Intellectual Property (IP) Rights
### 3.1 Artist Rights
- I retain the **copyright** and **ownership** of the artwork.
- I reserve the right to display the artwork in my portfolio, social media, and art books (unless a Non-Disclosure Agreement is signed for an additional fee).

### 3.3 Commercial Use
- Commercial rights must be discussed and purchased separately.
- Fees typically range from **50% to 200%** of the base price depending on the scale of distribution (e.g., indie game asset vs. mass-market merchandise).

# Philippines Legal & Tax Checklist (Freelance Artist)

*Disclaimer: This is for informational purposes only. Consult with a CPA or tax professional for authorized advice.*

## 1. Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Registration
**Goal**: Register as **"Professional - General"** (Self-Employed).

- [ ] **TIN (Tax Identification Number)**: Use existing or apply for one.
- [ ] **BIR Form 1901**: Application for Registration (Self-Employed).
- [ ] **Occupational Tax Receipt (OTR)**:
  -   **Where**: City/Municipal Hall.
  -   **Cost**: Approx. ₱450 - ₱500 / year.
  -   **Requirement**: Professional Tax Receipt (PTR) is for licensed pros (engineers/CPAs); OTR is for non-licensed pros (artists/writers).
- [ ] **Books of Accounts**:
  -   Register columnar ledgers (Cash Receipt Book, Cash Disbursement Book).
  -   *Note: Under Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act, registration of books is now easier, but maintenance is still required.*
- [ ] **Registration Fee**: The ₱500 annual registration fee (RF) has been **removed** as of Jan 2024 (EOPT Act), but verify if your RDO still requires a local fee or update fee.

## 2. Receipts & Invoices (EOPT Act Updates)
**Major Change**: The "Official Receipt" (OR) is no longer the primary document for services. It is now the **SERVICE INVOICE**.

- [ ] **Authority to Print (ATP)**: Apply using BIR Form 1906.
- [ ] **Service Invoice**:
  -   Primary evidence of sale for services.
  -   Must contain specific details (Name, TIN, Address of seller & buyer, etc.).
- [ ] **Secondary Documents** (Optional but good for records):
  -   Official Receipt (now just for collection acknowledgment, not tax credit evidence).
  -   Collection Receipt.

## 3. Tax Types (The 8% Option)
For freelancers earning **under ₱3,000,000** annually, the **8% Gross Income Tax** rate is highly recommended.

- **Benefits**:
  -   Replaces Graduated Income Tax (0-35%) + Percentage Tax (3%).
  -   Simpler computation: `(Gross Sales - ₱250,000) * 8%`.
  -   No need to itemize expenses.
- **How to avail**: Select "8% IT Rate" on your initial general registration or file it in your 1st Quarter Income Tax Return (Form 1701Q).

## 4. DTI & Business Permit (Optional for "Professional" status?)
- **Strictly speaking**: "Professionals" (using their own name) are often exempt from DTI and Mayor's Permit in many LGUs, paying only OTR.
- **However**: If you use a "Business Name" (e.g., "RedDragon Art Studio" instead of "Juan Dela Cruz"), you **MUST** get:
  -   DTI Certificate.
  -   Mayor's Permit / Business Permit.

*Recommendation: Register under your personal name first to simplify requirements.*

## 5. Filing Schedule
- **Quarterly Income Tax (1701Q)**:
  -   Q1: May 15
  -   Q2: Aug 15
  -   Q3: Nov 15
- **Annual Income Tax (1701A)**: April 15 of next year.

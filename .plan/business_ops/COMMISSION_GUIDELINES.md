# Commission Guidelines

Please review these guidelines to understand my workflow and limitations before submitting a request. My primary specialization is **Character Art**.

## What I Will & Will Not Draw

### ✅ I Will Draw (Do's)
- Original Characters (OCs)
- Fanart (Anime, Games, Movies)
- Real People (Stylized/Anime style)
- Kemonomimi (Humans with animal ears/tails)
- Mild Gore

### ❌ I Will NOT Draw (Don'ts)
- Mecha / Heavy Machinery (Detailed robots)
- Furry (Anthropomorphic animals)
- Excessive Gore / Violence
- Political / Hate Art
- Imitation of other specific artists' styles
- **NSFW / Nudity / Sexual Content**

*Note: I reserve the right to decline a commission if I feel I cannot do justice to the subject matter.*

## The Process

1.  **Inquiry**: You fill out the commission form.
2.  **Quote & Invoice**: I review your request and send a final quote. Once agreed, I send an invoice/payment link.
3.  **Sketch Phase**:
    - I will send a rough sketch for your approval.
    - **Action**: This is the time to ask for BIG changes (pose, outfit, expression).
4.  **tLineart & Base Color**:
    - I refine the lines and apply base colors.
    - **Action**: Check for color accuracy. Minor tweaks only.
5.  **Final Render**:
    - Shading, lighting, and effects are applied.
    - **Action**: Final review. Only small adjustments (e.g., eye color brightness) allowed.
6.  **Delivery**: High-resolution files (PNG/JPG) are sent via email/Google Drive.

## Standard Revision Policy
To keep the workflow efficient, revisions are structured as follows:

- **Sketch Phase**: Unlimited major revisions (within reason). Let's get the foundation right!
- **Coloring Phase**: 2 rounds of minor color adjustments.
- **Post-Completion**: Any changes to approved elements (e.g., "Actually, can you change the pose?") will be treated as a new commission or incur a significant fee.

**Fee for Extra Revisions**: $10 / ₱500 per round beyond the standard allowance.

## Rush Orders
Need it ASAP?

- **Standard**: No specific deadline (1-3 weeks).
- **Priority**: Delivered within 7 days (+25% fee).
- **Urgent**: Delivered within 3 days (+50% fee).
- **24-Hour**: Discussed on a case-by-case basis (+100% fee).

*Rush fees cover the cost of me working overtime or pushing back other slots.*

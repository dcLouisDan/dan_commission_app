# Pricing Strategy & Tier Structure

This document outlines a proposed pricing structure designed to balance accessibility for local (PH) clients while capturing the value of the international market.

## Strategy: "Local Friendly, Global Standard"
The goal is to avoid underpricing yourself globally while still allowing friends/local networks to commission you.

**Market Positioning**:
- **International (USD)**: Positioned as "Mid-Level Professional" (Quality/Reliability focus).
- **Local (PHP)**: Discounted rate (~60-70% of USD converted rate) to match local purchasing power, but strictly limited to "Personal Use" or "Local Friend" slots.

## Proposed Pricing Tiers

### 1. Sketch / Rough (Entry Level)
*Clean sketch with minimal shading. Good for quick ideas.*
- **International**: $25 - $40
- **PH Local**: ₱800 - ₱1,200

### 2. Flat Color / Cel Shaded (Standard)
*Clean lines, solid colors, basic shadows. The most popular option.*
- **Headshot**: $45
- **Half-Body**: $65
- **Full Body**: $85
- **PH Local**: ₱1,500 / ₱2,500 / ₱3,500

### 3. Full Render (Premium)
*High detail, lighting, background elements. "Splash Art" quality.*
- **Headshot**: $70
- **Half-Body**: $100
- **Full Body**: $140+
- **PH Local**: ₱2,500 / ₱4,000 / ₱6,000

## Add-Ons
- **Complex Background**: +$30-50 / +₱1,500
- **Extra Character**: +75% of base price
- **Commercial Use Fee**: +100% (2x price) for Indie use / +200% (3x price) for Corporate use.

## The "Local Rate" Rule
To prevent arbitrage (someone buying cheap locally and reselling globally):
1.  **Limited Slots**: Only open 2-3 "Local Slots" per month.
2.  **Payment Method**: Local rates MUST pay via GCash/Maya/BPI. USD rates via PayPal/Stripe.
3.  **Strict IP**: Local rates are STRICTLY Personal Use Only.

## Quarterly Review
Re-evaluate prices every 3 months. If your slots sell out within 24 hours, **raise your prices by 15-20%** for the next batch.
